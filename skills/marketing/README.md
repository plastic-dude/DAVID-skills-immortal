# Developer Marketing Skills

AI agent skills for marketing to developers — inspired by [marketingskills](https://github.com/coreyhaines31/marketingskills). These skills give coding agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, etc.) specialized knowledge for developer-focused marketing tasks.

## Why Developer Marketing Is Different

Developers have a finely-tuned BS detector. They:

- **Skip landing pages** → Go straight to docs, GitHub, or the API reference
- **Distrust marketing speak** → Want technical accuracy and honest tradeoffs
- **Value transparency** → Open source, public roadmaps, honest pricing
- **Research thoroughly** → Read HN comments, Reddit threads, GitHub issues before buying
- **Influence purchasing** → Even when not the buyer, they're the decision-maker

These skills are built around those realities.

## What Are Skills?

Skills are markdown files that give AI agents specialized knowledge and workflows for specific tasks. When you add these to your project, your agent can recognize when you're working on a developer marketing task and apply the right frameworks and best practices.

## Usage

Once installed, your agent recognizes developer marketing tasks naturally:

```
"Help me write a Show HN post for our new CLI"
→ Uses hacker-news-strategy skill

"Write a getting started guide for our Python SDK"
→ Uses technical-tutorials + docs-as-marketing skills

"Find Reddit threads where devs are frustrated with [competitor]"
→ Uses developer-listening skill

"Optimize our signup flow - too many devs dropping off"
→ Uses developer-signup-flow skill
```

You can also invoke skills directly:

```
/developer-listening
/hacker-news-strategy
/devrel-content
```

---

## Usage Examples

### Find engagement opportunities

```
/developer-listening

Find conversations where developers are frustrated with [competitor]
and looking for alternatives. Focus on Reddit and Hacker News from the past week.
```

### Write a technical tutorial

```
/technical-tutorials

Write a quickstart guide for integrating our SDK with Next.js.
Target: intermediate developers familiar with React but new to our tool.
```

### Optimize developer onboarding

```
/developer-onboarding

Audit our current signup-to-first-API-call flow.
Identify friction points and suggest improvements.
```
